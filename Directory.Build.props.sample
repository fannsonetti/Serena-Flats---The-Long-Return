    Local developer overrides for Schedule I install path.
    How to use on your machine:
      1) Copy this file to: Directory.Build.props (same folder as this file)
         Do NOT commit your personal Directory.Build.props.
      2) Edit ScheduleIGameDir below to point to your local game directory.
         Example locations:
           - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Schedule I
           - D:\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\Schedule I
      3) Alternatively, set an environment variable named SCHEDULE_I_GAME_DIR
         to the same path; that also works without creating a local props file.
  -->
  <PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Absolute path to your Schedule I game folder -->
    <ScheduleIGameDir>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Schedule I</ScheduleIGameDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
